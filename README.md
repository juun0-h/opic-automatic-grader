# 🎓 Capstone Design Project: AI-Powered OPIc Speaking Assessment and Feedback Tool
---

### This project is a capstone design project developed to automate the OPIc (Oral Proficiency Interview-computer) speaking assessment process and provide personalized feedback to users. The tool leverages OpenAI's Whisper model for accurate speech-to-text transcription and a fine-tuned RoBERTa model for automatic grading based on multiple criteria.

## Key Features
- Automatic Speech Recognition: Accurately transcribes spoken English responses using OpenAI's Whisper model.
- Multi-Criteria Grading: Evaluates speaking proficiency based on task completion, accuracy, and appropriateness.
- Personalized Feedback: Generates tailored feedback for each user, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
- User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for recording responses and reviewing feedback.

## Technologies Used
- Flask: Web framework for building the application.
- MySQL: Database for storing user data and responses.
- OpenAI Whisper: Speech-to-text model for transcription.
- Hugging Face Transformers (Roberta): Fine-tuned model for automatic grading.
- LangChain: Framework for building LLM-powered applications.
